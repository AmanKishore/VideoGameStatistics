# Video Game: Fortniteâ€™s Success Path and Trajectory

For the past couple of months, Fortnite has taken the world by storm, dominating the industry and generating over $1 billion with in-game purchases. As with many games before it, there have been periods of success followed by a decline in interest often due to another game replacing it. Right now, Fortnite is dominating the landscape, bringing a new genre of gameplay in the form or Battle Royale. In this style, a large amount of players (usually around 100) gather materials and fight till the last person or team is standing. Although this game mode existed before, Fortnite was the first Battle Royale mode to add a building aspect to the game. This addition is eerily reminiscent of an older but wildly successful game, Minecraft.

One of the most successful games of all time is Minecraft, a game dedicated to creativity with complete control over the landscape and with endless limitations. Minecraft not only affected the gaming industry by revolutionizing open world maps, the game also had a far reaching impact into the online gaming and online video industries.

Accomplishing this:
To accomplish this, we decided to take a couple of paths to help us decide what was feasible and what would not work 

First we looked at APIs

We looked at the Google News API

Then we looked at the YouTube API

Then we looked at an unofficial Google Trends API

Since not all of the video game companies are publicly traded we skipped looking at the Nasdaq API as it would not help us in all cases of video games as we were trying to do
